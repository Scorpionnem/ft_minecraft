# ft_minecraft

42 ft_minecraft project.

This project is part of the 42 advanced curriculum. It will make us learn about advanced rendering techniques, procedural generation and networking.
This project comes after [ft_vox](https://github.com/Manualouest/ft_vox) (Beware my code wasnt the best back then!) and is pretty much about upgrading it.
It also allows us to discover how to create a "basic" game engine.
